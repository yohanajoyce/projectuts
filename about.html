        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Yohana Pricilia Joyce, and I am currently a 2nd semester student at Bali Institute of Design and Business majoring in Business Information Systems and Technology. I have a great interest in technology, and business, and I am excited to learn and develop my skills in this field. I enjoy spending my free time reading, exercising, or hanging out with friends. Outside of my studies, I am actively involved in departmental organizations, which gives me the opportunity to learn more and contribute to the surrounding environment.
        </p>
        <p>My goal in this education is to earn a lot of money. I believe that with dedication and hard work, I can achieve my dreams. Thank you for visiting this page! If you'd like to get to know me further or discuss, feel free to contact me.
